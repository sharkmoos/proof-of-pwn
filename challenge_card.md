## Description

If you're a bit of a satanist or well-read you may have heard of the gates, levels, rings, or spheres of hell. If you
can't be bothered to read Dante's Inferno, [here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/articles/a-visitors-guide-to-dantes-nine-circles-of-hell/)
is an interesting/humorous summary. Essentially things start of pretty dandy, and the further you get in the more shit it
gets, which is a pretty fair reflection of this challenge!
